# FreeCodeCamp-Triubute-page
FreeCodeCamp project Tribute page

FreeCodeCamp Project. I followed my own steps because I wanted to practise the knowledge I acquired over time. I had to build a simple tribute page dedicated to anyone. I built using the ATOM IDE becuse this is what I used to design websites. I added some of my own steps but I kept it simple just to follow along the steps that I learnt when I was on FreeCodeCamp.

The course taught me the basics of HTML5 and CSS3.

I did have some issues but I used CSS3, more specifcally I used padding to fix some issues within the margin.

What could I do to improve the projects:
> I would add different aniamtions of the images
> I would also add a theme over the website using Bootstrap 
> I would add JavaScript and replace the animations of the menu

What did I learn from this project?
I learnt how to maintain the code and keep it simple. I also learnt that I could of used some free themes and then change them to save time but when I made the website I decided to skip over those things in order to keep it simple.

I built the project using HTML5 and CSS3.
